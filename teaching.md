  - Responsible for teaching of one lab.
- **[IV121 Computer science applications in biology](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/jaro2021/IV121)**
  - Responsible for the part of the course (both lectures and labs) about biomedical networked data, text mining, machine learning and selected AI applications.


In the **Fall** semester of **2021**, I'll teach the following course:
- **[PB016 Artificial Intelligence I](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/podzim2020/PB016)** 
  - In this course I've been responsible for the creation and maintenance of the lab materials, the lab organisation and coordination of the lab tutors, and I'll also teach quite a few of the labs themselves (in both English and Czech).
