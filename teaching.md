Every semester since fall, 2020, I haunt various lecture rooms and labs at the premises of the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.fi.muni.cz/) of [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/). I primarily focus on large introductory AI and machine learning courses, and focused seminars on applications of these disciplines in biology and medicine. For an up-to-date list of the courses I teach, please refer to my [university profile](https://www.muni.cz/en/people/4049-vit-novacek/teaching).
