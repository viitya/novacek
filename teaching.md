As of the **Fall** semester of **2020**, I teach the following course:

* [**PB016 Artificial Intelligence I**](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/podzim2020/PB016) at the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.fi.muni.cz/) of [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/)
 * In this course I've been responsible for the creation and maintenance of the lab materials, the lab organisation and coordination of the lab tutors, and I also teach quite a few of the labs themselves (in both English and Czech).
