*[tl;dr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tl;dr)* - For quite a while, I've been adding my tiny little bits to the state of the art in [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and [health informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics). For a longer story about how that came to be, keep on reading...

Much to the despair of my loved ones, my curiosity has always been stronger than my common sense. That has led to my unreasonably eclectic research interests that have spanned the fields of mathematics, physics, philosophy, linguistics, political, cognitive and computer science, evolutionary, molecular and systems biology, medicine and what not (in more or less chronological order as to the time when I got afflicted with each of those particular obsessions).

Obviously, I've never been able to learn enough to truly crack even some of the minor mysteries in any of those fields. But already during my PhD studies it dawned on me that perhaps some sort of biomedically-inclined AI research could be my thing (I won a nice little glass sculpture for doing that stuff, with $15,000 prize money to boot, which I took as a rather strong hint).

Somehow, not too long after I got that shiny piece of paper calling me a doctor, I happened to get involved in a cool project funded by [Fujitsu Laboratories Limited](https://www.fujitsu.com/jp/group/labs/en/). It was called **KI2NA** for the first three years, then **TOMOE** for nearly four more. It's all top industrial secret so there is no public web page, but let me just say we had a lot of fun with my best friend and former colleague [Pierre-Yves](http://pyvandenbussche.info/) with whom we ended up coordinating the whole thing (and gorging on vast amounts of adventurous foodstuffs during our regular trips to Japan). Over the years, we built a team of young but tremendously progressive researchers, and delivered some cutting-edge relational learning solutions for discovering links between drugs, proteins and disorders. Some of the predictions of our models even got confirmed in living human cells by our most kind and capable colleagues at [Systems Biology Ireland](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/). Other than piquing the interest of a few pharma and biotech companies, that success reassured us about the validity and necessity of this particular field of applied AI research.

Most recently, the still somewhat unbelievable relevance of my lofty research vision got further confirmed by an acquisition of the **[CLARIFY](https://www.clarify2020.eu/)** [H2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en) EU project. My specific role in that project is to coordinate the development of AI solutions that could use various biomedical data to predict the risk that specific patients develop adverse effects of their oncological treatments over time. The project has only started in 2020 so there's not much to report yet, but once we start churning out something newsworthy, I'll sure post it here.
