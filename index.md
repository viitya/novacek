Hey, I'm **Vít**. In the context of this web space, I'm primarily an [Associate Professor](https://is.muni.cz/person/vitya) of Computer Science at the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.fi.muni.cz/) of [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/). Check the [Bio section](bio.html) for my other affiliations and stuff. Nováček is the second name, by the way. You may also call me dubious doctor of philosophy, not quite full professor, an incessantly puzzled scholar or whatever other fancy title suits you. But I sure won't mind Vít, Vítek or Víťa if that's what you would prefer (perhaps slightly foolishly, I believe mutual respect is not necessarily correlated with formal figures of speech).

As to my personal background, I spent some of my most formative years roaming the [wild west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Atlantic_Way) of the [Emerald Isle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland), where at least half of my soul and heart still reside. Yet I also have undeniable roots in the [Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic), where I have been based again since 2020. Both English and Czech are thus perfectly fine when aiming to elicit some response from me. You may try [Gaelige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) as well, but—eternally ashamed as I am of my ignorance in this respect—you'd do better addressing, say, an [Irish Wolfhound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_wolfhound) in that language if a semblance of meaningful conversation is what you seek.

Besides making sense of my unreasonably eclectic [research interests](research.html), I strive to become a decent [teacher](teaching.html) one day. And in whatever spare time remains then, I try my best to keep stoking my [other passions](life.html) (which most certainly do not include web desgin, as you may have noticed from the appearance of this space).
