Hey, I'm **Vít**. In the context of this web space, I'm primarily an [Assistant Professor](https://is.muni.cz/person/vitya) of Computer Science at the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.fi.muni.cz/) of [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/). Other than that, I still help to lead the [Unit for Biomedical Discovery Informatics](https://dsi.nuigalway.ie/units/bdi) at the [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.nuigalway.ie/) of [National University of Ireland Galway](https://www.nuigalway.ie/) where I worked full-time until August 2020. Nováček is the second name, by the way. You may also call me dubious doctor of philosophy, not quite full professor, an incessantly puzzled scholar or whatever other fancy title suits you. But I sure won't mind Vít, Vítek or Víťa if that's what you would prefer (perhaps slightly foolishly, I tend to believe mutual respect is not necessarily correlated with formal figures of speech).

As to my personal background, I'm a naturalised Irishman who spent some of his most formative years roaming the [wild west coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Atlantic_Way) of the fabled [Éire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) island. Yet I also have undeniable [Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic) roots, and therefore both English and Czech are perfectly fine when aiming to elicit some response from me. You may try [Gaelige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) as well, but—eternally ashamed as I am of my ignorance in this respect—you'd do better addressing, say, an [Irish Wolfhound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_wolfhound) in that language if a semblance of meaningful conversation is what you seek.

Besides making sense of my unreasonably eclectic [research interests](research.html), I strive to become a decent [teacher](teaching.html) one day. And in whatever spare time remains then, I try my best to keep stoking my [other passions](life.html). However, as you may have noticed from the sloppy-minimalist means I chose for publishing this thing, web design is most certainly not one of them.
