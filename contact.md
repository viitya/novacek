When I'm not too freaked out about the swarms of viruses raging in public places, one can find me in the **office C.221** at the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.fi.muni.cz/) of [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/). My goal for the pandemic Fall semester of 2020 is to be there at the very least on **Mondays**, and I would typically be available for **individual meetings** (e.g. with students) between **3-5pm** on those days. Arranging a meeting at a different time is always possible - just let me know at least 2 days ahead and we'll figure it out somehow.

My **office phone** is +420 549 497 549.

Other than that, I should be able to respond pretty swiftly to any reasonable queries via my **email** [novacek@fi.muni.cz](mailto:novacek@fi.muni.cz).

Last but not least, my **regular mail address** is: Vít Nováček, Office C.221, Botanická 68a, 602 00, Brno, Czech Republic.
