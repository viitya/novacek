When I'm not freaking out about swarms of viruses raging in public places (v.2020) or a nuclear war looming just around the corner (v.2023), one can find me in the **office C221** at the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.fi.muni.cz/) of [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/). If you want to meet me there (or indeed anywhere else, be it physically or online), best is to let me know at least two days ahead and we'll figure it out somehow.

My **office phone** is +420 5 4949 7549.

My preferred contact is my **email** [novacek@fi.muni.cz](mailto:novacek@fi.muni.cz), though. When I'm not somewhere in the woods or lost at sea, I should respond pretty swiftly to any reasonable queries there.

Last but not least, my **postal address** is: Vít Nováček, Office C221, Botanická 68a, 602 00, Brno, Czech Republic.
