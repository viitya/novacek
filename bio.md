Dr. Vít Nováček (male) holds a PhD from the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI) at the National University of Ireland, Galway (now transformed into DSI, NUI Galway). Apart from that, Vít has BSc and MSc degrees in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence (AI), and also BA degrees in political science and media studies, all from Masaryk University in the Czech Republic. Vít is currently an Assistant Professor at the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.fi.muni.cz/) of [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/). He is also a part-time Research Fellow at the [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.nuigalway.ie/) of [National University of Ireland Galway](https://www.nuigalway.ie/), leading the Biomedical Discovery Informatics Unit there. In past he was a visiting research fellow and research affiliate at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://isi.edu/) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) (working on a literature-based discovery tool and providing consultancy services on the IARPA TechKnAqc project).

Vít’s personal research interests revolve around developing machine-aided discovery solutions by means of machine / representation / relational learning, explainable AI and text mining, with a strong focus on biomedical use cases (e.g. prediction of adverse drug effects, protein drug targets or signalling reactions). Vít has a strong track record in applying his research to industrial use cases (primarily within a six year, multi-million euro collaboration with Fujitsu Laboratories Limited). He also coordinated the ICT branch of the ISCA-Japan SFI project at NUI Galway.

Vít has been the primary, sole or senior author of over 35 peer-reviewed international publications, and a designated inventor on 7 patents. He was a plenary speaker at a premier national AI conference, invited panelist at IEEE’s CBMS (one of the top international conferences in medical informatics), and served on dozens of program or organisation committees of international conferences and workshops (including top venues like CIKM or AAAI). In 2009, Vít led a team that won the 2nd prize in the Elsevier Grand Challenge competition which was aimed at knowledge enhancement in life sciences. His team beat groups from Stanford, CMU and 70 other high profile institutions from all over the world in the process, and brought home $15,000 prize money. Speaking of money, Vít has been instrumental in securing over 3.5 million euros worth of funding to date, with over 1,200,000 euros from that funding allocated directly to Vít’s research groups.
